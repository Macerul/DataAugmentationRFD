# Preserving Relaxed Dependencies in Data Augmentation: A new RFD-driven Algorithm

We present SyRFD, the first algorithm that preserves Relaxed Functional Dependencies (RFDs) during tabular data generation.

## Usage/Examples
Before starting the generation process, please set the desired parameters (note that once you have performed data augmentation for a desired threshold, before moving on to the next one, delete all generated files in the folders diff_matrices and diff_tuples)
```python
# SyRFD settings
augmenter = RFDAwareAugmenter(
            imbalance_dataset_path=data_path,
            rfd_file_path=RFD_FILE,
            oversampling=required_train_samples,
            threshold=thr,  # RFDcs similarity threshold
            max_iter=5,  # Maximum attempts per tuple generation
            selected_rfds=None  # Use None for to process all RFDcs, or specify list of rfds to be considered
)
```
To start generating new samples and start the classification with SyRFD, run:
```python
classification_grid_search_syrfd.py
```

To evaluate with other state-of-the-art methods, run:
```python
classification_grid_search_{method}.py
```

Please note that for SMOTE-CDDN you need to install its requiremets, and run:
```python
classification.py
```

To evaluate using the already generated samples (please note you need to change to the desired new_tuples path and the method you want to start the evaluation for), run:
```python
nuovetuple = pd.read_csv(f"classification_results_SYRFD_thr{thr}/new_tuples/{ds}_new_tuples_{thr}.csv") # change the thr accordingly

nuovetuple = pd.read_csv(f"classification_results_{method}/new_tuples/{ds}_new_tuples_{method}.csv") # for the other state-of-the-art methods
```
```python
classification_grid_search_noaug.py

```
